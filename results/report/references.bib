	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy (PP) is common in elderly population and associated with some adverse clinical outcomes and increases healthcare burdens. We performed this systemic review and meta-analysis to estimate worldwide prevalence of PP and explore associated factors in the elderly.
METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Ovid EMBASE databases were searched for studies published until May 30, 2022. We included observational studies representative of general patients aged ≥60 in which PP was defined as multiple drugs ≥5. Studies were excluded if only a particular group of the elderly population (e.g., with diabetes) were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of PP. Random-effect models were employed to estimate the overall or variable-specific pooled estimates of PP. Secondary outcomes were hyperpolypharmacy (HPP, defined as multiple drugs ≥10) and PP prevalence based on different study years, genders, locations, populations, and so forth.
RESULTS: We included 122 original observational studies with an overall population of 57 328 043 individuals in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of PP and HPP in the elderly population worldwide was 39.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 35.5\%-42.7\%) and 13.3\% (95\% CI, 10.4\%-16.5\%), respectively. The prevalence of PP in Europe, Oceania, North America, Asia, and South America was 45.8\% (95\% CI, 41.5\%-50.2\%), 45.5\% (95\% CI, 26.7\%-64.3\%), 40.8\% (95\% CI, 29.8\%-51.6\%), 29.0\% (95\% CI, 20.0\%-38.0\%), and 28.4\% (95\% CI, 24.0\%-32.8\%), respectively (p {\textless} 0.01). Multivariate meta-regressions showed geographical regions of Europe or North America, age ≥70, and residence from nursing homes were independently associated with higher PP prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 40\% of the elderly population is exposed to PP. The prevalence of PP is significantly higher in elderly individuals aged 70 or older, in developed regions and in nursing homes. It is important to focus on avoiding inappropriate PP in this population to address the growing burden of PP.},

	abstract = {Adverse drug reactions account for a substantial portion of emergency hospital admissions. However, in the last decade, few studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of hospitalization due to adverse drug reactions. Therefore, this cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the proportion of adverse drug reactions leading to emergency hospital admission and to evaluate the risk factors for these reactions. A total of 5707 consecutive patients aged {\textgreater} 18 years who were emergently hospitalized due to acute medical illnesses between June 2018 and May 2021 were included. Causality assessment for adverse drug reactions was performed by using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre criteria. The median patient age was 78 years (IQR 63–87), and the proportion of women was 47.9\%. Among all the hospitalizations, 287 (5.0\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 4.5–5.6\%) were caused by 368 adverse drug reactions. The risk factors independently associated with hospitalization due to adverse drug reactions were polypharmacy (OR 2.66), age ≥ 65 years (OR 2.00), and ambulance use (OR 1.41). Given that the population is rapidly aging worldwide, further efforts are needed to minimize hospitalizations caused by adverse drug reactions.},

A better understanding of opioid analgesics combination therapy used for pain management could help warrant medication safety, efficacy, and economic relevance. Until now there has been no review summarizing the opioid analgesics-related pharmacokinetic drug interactions from the perspective of evidence based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Method: A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library, using a PRISMA flowchart. Results: Fifty-two RCTs were included for data interpretation. Forty-two RCTs (80.8\%) were conducted in healthy volunteers, whereas 10 RCTs (19.2\%) enrolled true patients. None of the opioid\&ndash;drug/herb pairs was listed as contraindications of opioids involved in this review. Circumstances in which opioid is comedicated as a precipitant drug include morphine\&ndash;P2Y12 inhibitors, morphine\&ndash;gabapentin, and methadone\&ndash;zidovudine. Circumstances in which opioid is comedicated as an object drug include rifampin\&ndash;opioids (morphine, tramadol, oxycodone, methadone), quinidine\&ndash;opioids (morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, codeine, dihydrocodeine, methadone), antimycotics\&ndash;opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, tilidine, tramadol), protease inhibitors\&ndash;opioids (ritonavir, ritonavir/lopinavir\&ndash;oxycodone, ritonavir\&ndash;fentanyl, ritonavir\&ndash;tilidine), grapefruit juice\&ndash;opioids (oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone), antidepressants\&ndash;opioids (paroxetine\&ndash;tramadol, paroxetine\&ndash;hydrocodone, paroxetine\&ndash;oxycodone, escitalopram\&ndash;tramadol), metoclopramide\&ndash;morphine, amantadine\&ndash;morphine, sumatriptan\&ndash;butorphanol nasal sprays, ticlopidine\&ndash;tramadol, St John\&rsquo;s wort\&ndash;oxycodone, macrolides/ketolides\&ndash;oxycodone, and levomepromazine\&ndash;codeine. RCTs investigating the same combination, almost unanimously, drew consistent conclusions, except two RCTs on amantadine\&ndash;intravenous morphine combination where a different amantadine dose was used and two RCTs on morphine\&ndash;ticagrelor combination where healthy volunteers and true patients were enrolled, respectively. RCTs investigating in true patients may reflect a realistic clinical scenario and overcome the limitation of RCTs performed in healthy volunteers under standardized conditions. Further research opportunities are also presented in this review. Conclusion: Effective and safe combination therapy of opioids can be achieved by promoting the awareness of potential changes in therapeutic efficacy and toxicities, prescribing alternatives or changing administration strategy, tailoring dose, reviewing the appropriateness of orders, and paying attention to medication monitoring.

	abstract = {Background
Adverse drug events, the unintended and harmful effects of medications, are important outcome measures in health services research. Yet no universally accepted set of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) revision 10 codes or coding algorithms exists to ensure their consistent identification in administrative data. Our objective was to synthesize a comprehensive set of ICD-10 codes used to identify adverse drug events.

Methods
We developed a systematic search strategy and applied it to five electronic reference databases. We searched relevant medical journals, conference proceedings, electronic grey literature and bibliographies of relevant studies, and contacted content experts for unpublished studies. One author reviewed the titles and abstracts for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors reviewed eligible full-text articles and abstracted data in duplicate. Data were synthesized in a qualitative manner.

Results
Of 4241 titles identified, 41 were included. We found a total of 827 ICD-10 codes that have been used in the medical literature to identify adverse drug events. The median number of codes used to search for adverse drug events was 190 (IQR 156–289) with a large degree of variability between studies in the numbers and types of codes used. Authors commonly used external injury (Y40.0–59.9) and disease manifestation codes. Only two papers reported on the sensitivity of their code set.

Conclusions
Substantial variability exists in the methods used to identify adverse drug events in administrative data. Our work may serve as a point of reference for future research and consensus building in this area.},

	abstract = {Background
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are not only a safety and quality of care issue for patients, but also an economic issue with significant costs. Because they often occur during hospital stays, it is necessary to accurately quantify the costs of ADEs. This review aimed to investigate the methods to calculate these costs, and to characterize their nature.

Methods
A systematic literature review was conducted to identify methods used to assess the cost of ADEs on Medline, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Original articles published from 2017 to 2022 in English and French were included. Economic evaluations were included if they concerned inpatients.

Results
From 127 studies screened, 20 studies were analyzed. There was a high heterogeneity in nature of costs, methods used, values obtained, and time horizon chosen. A small number of studies considered non-medical (10\%), indirect (20\%) and opportunity costs (5\%). Ten different methods for assessing the cost of ADEs have been reported and nine studies did not explain how they obtained their values.

Conclusions
There is no consensus in the literature on how to assess the costs of ADEs, due to the heterogeneity of contexts and the choice of different economic perspectives. Our study adds a well-deserved overview of the existing literature that can be a solid lead for future studies and method implementation.

	abstract = {Background: The phecode system was built upon the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) using the electronic health record (EHR).
Objective: The goal of this paper was to develop and perform an initial evaluation of maps from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes to phecodes.
Methods: We mapped ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM codes to phecodes using a number of methods and resources, such as concept relationships and explicit mappings from the Centers for Medicare \&amp; Medicaid Services, the Unified Medical Language System, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms, and the National Library of Medicine. We assessed the coverage of the maps in two databases: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) using ICD-10-CM and the UK Biobank (UKBB) using ICD-10. We assessed the fidelity of the ICD-10-CM map in comparison to the gold-standard ICD-9-CM phecode map by investigating phenotype reproducibility and conducting a PheWAS.
Results: We mapped \&gt;75\% of ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM codes to phecodes. Of the unique codes observed in the UKBB (ICD-10) and VUMC (ICD-10-CM) cohorts, \&gt;90\% were mapped to phecodes. We observed 70-75\% reproducibility for chronic diseases and \&lt;10\% for an acute disease for phenotypes sourced from the ICD-10-CM phecode map. Using the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM maps, we conducted a PheWAS with a Lipoprotein(a) genetic variant, rs10455872, which replicated two known genotype-phenotype associations with similar effect sizes: coronary atherosclerosis (ICD-9-CM: P\&lt;.001; odds ratio (OR) 1.60 [95\% CI 1.43-1.80] vs ICD-10-CM: P\&lt;.001; OR 1.60 [95\% CI 1.43-1.80]) and chronic ischemic heart disease (ICD-9-CM: P\&lt;.001; OR 1.56 [95\% CI 1.35-1.79] vs ICD-10-CM: P\&lt;.001; OR 1.47 [95\% CI 1.22-1.77]).
Conclusions: This study introduces the beta versions of ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM to phecode maps that enable researchers to leverage accumulated ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM data for PheWAS in the EHR.},

	abstract = {Background: The United States (US) ranks high, nationally, in opioid consumption. The ongoing increase in the misuse and mortality amid the opioid epidemic has been contributing to its rising cost. The worsening health and economic impact of opioid use disorder in the US warrants further attention. We, therefore, assessed commonly prescribed opioids to determine the opioids that were over-represented versus under-represented for adverse drug events (ADEs) to better understand their distribution patterns using the Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) while correcting for distribution using the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS). Comparing the ratio of the percentage of adverse drug events as reported by the FAERS relative to the percentage of distribution as reported by the ARCOS database is a novel approach to evaluate post-marketing safety surveillance and may inform healthcare policies and providers to better regulate the use of these opioids., 
Methods: We analyzed the adverse events for 11 prescription opioids, when correcting for distribution, and their ratios for three periods, 2006–2010, 2011–2016, and 2017–2021, in the US. The opioids include buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Oral morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) were calculated by conversions relative to morphine. The relative ADEs of the selected opioids, opioid distributions, and ADEs relative to distribution ratios were analyzed for the 11 opioids., 
Results: Oxycodone, fentanyl, and morphine accounted for over half of the total number of ADEs (n = 667,969), while meperidine accounted for less than 1\%. Opioid distributions were relatively constant over time, with methadone repeatedly accounting for the largest proportions. Many ADE-to-opioid distribution ratios increased over time, with meperidine (60.6), oxymorphone (11.1), tapentadol (10.3), and hydromorphone (7.9) being the most over-represented for ADEs in the most recent period. Methadone was under-represented ({\textless}0.20) in all the three periods., 
Conclusion: The use of the FAERS with the ARCOS provides insights into dynamic changes in ADEs of the selected opioids in the US. There is further need to monitor and address the ADEs of these drugs.},

	abstract = {The US FDA issued a black-box warning against co-prescription of antipsychotic (AP) agents and opioids due to the risk of respiratory depression, but evidence on the comparative safety of sedating vs nonsedating APs is lacking. We classified APs as sedating (eg, quetiapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine) and nonsedating (eg, aripiprazole, haloperidol, and risperidone) based on their affinity to the histamine-1 neuroreceptor (Ki {\textless} or ≥20, respectively) and sought to compare the rate of overdose between patients using sedating vs nonsedating APs plus opioids. We constructed a population-based cohort nested in the IBM MarketScan database (2004–2017). Patients with concomitant use of sedating APs and prescription opioids (“exposed”) were 1:1 matched to patients with concomitant use of nonsedating APs and prescription opioids (“referent”) based on the propensity score (PS). The primary outcome was any hospitalization or emergency department visit due to an overdose within 30 days. The final cohort comprised 62 604 exposed and an equal number of PS-matched reference patients. Characteristics of matched exposed and reference patients were similar. There were 178 overdose events among the exposed (35.3 events per 1000 person-years [PY]) vs 133 among the reference group (26.4 events per 1000 PY), for an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.34 (95\% CI: 1.07-1.68). This finding was consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Among patients receiving prescription opioids, concomitant use of sedating APs was associated with an increased risk of overdose compared with nonsedating APs. Caution is required when co-prescribing opioids and APs. If co-prescription is needed, choosing a nonsedating agent should be preferred whenever possible given the clinical context.},

	abstract = {• Background: The use of opioid–gabapentinoid combinations has increased, raising several safety concerns. However, meta-analysis studies focusing on this issue are limited.• Objective: To evaluate the risk of central nervous system (CNS) depression, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, and mortality of combination therapy compared with those of opioid therapy and to explore the differences in the results according to study design and indications.• Methods: Relevant studies were selected (published before January 30, 2022) by searching the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. The pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of the outcomes were estimated using the Mantel–Haenszel method. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed according to study characteristics. Quality assessment was conducted using the Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias in non-RCTs tool for non-randomized trials.• Results: Adverse events were reported in 26 RCTs and 7 non-RCTs, and mortality was reported in 10 non-RCTs. Compared to opioid therapy, dizziness, cognitive dysfunction, and respiratory depression in combination therapy significantly increased in non-RCTs (OR 3.26, 95\% CI 1.82–5.85; OR 3.13, 95\% CI 1.51–6.50; OR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.31–2.24, respectively), and a similar trend for dizziness and cognitive dysfunction was also identified in the RCT analysis, although the difference was not significant. Combination therapy for cancer pain was associated with the highest risk of sedation in subgroup analysis. Combination therapy significantly decreased the risk of GI adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The mortality risk associated with combination therapy was higher than that associated with opioid therapy (OR 2.76, 95\% CI 1.26–6.05).• Conclusions: Opioid-gabapentinoid combination therapy could be associated with an increased risk of CNS depression and mortality, despite tolerable GI adverse events. These data suggest that combination therapy requires close monitoring of CNS depression, especially in cancer patients. Caution is needed in interpreting the clinical meanings owing to the lack of risk difference in respiratory depression in the RCT-only analysis and the absence of RCT or prospective studies investigating mortality.},
